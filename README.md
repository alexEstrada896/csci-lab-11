1. (5 pts) Write a complete program in C++ that prompts the user to enter two different numbers. Your program must validate input (assume the user will at least enter numbers) and not accept two numbers that are the same. The program should then only use the conditional operator to determine and tell the user which number is the smaller and which is the larger. 

A sample output on invalid inputs:

The two numbers you entered are the same. Please enter two different numbers.
A sample output on valid input:

99 is the smaller number, 100 is the bigger number.

2. (5 pts) Write a program that prompts the user to enter a day of the week (as a number between 1 and 7). Your program will then display the name of the corresponding day. The program must use a switch statement. Your program must also implement input validation (assume the user will at least enter numbers), and output an error message when the user enters anything not within the valid range.  

Sample output on a valid input:

Day 5 is Friday.
